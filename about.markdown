This website provides resources for all labs and researchers interested in Temporal Interference (TI) Stimulation. Information is available on hardware that can be used for TI experiments, testing protocols for TI experiments, and relevant news/updates in the field.

TI stimulation is a novel technique of brain stimulation using two or more high frequency carriers. There is an exciting amount of research emerging, delving into its mechanisms, applications, and improvements. The field has attracted computational and experimental scientists with a broad range of expertise, including Physics, Engineering, Neuroscience, Neurology, and Psychiatry. The transformative potential of TI brain stimulation has garnered notable recognition, including a prestigious award from [Science](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aau4915?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed), and has galvanised companies in developing products to support this nascent field. Its promise has also captured the attention of the general public, with coverage from [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/01/health/new-electrical-brain-stimulation-technique-shows-promise-in-mice.html), [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/science/neurophilosophy/2017/jun/01/researchers-develop-non-invasive-deep-brain-stimulation-method), and [The Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/01/health/new-electrical-brain-stimulation-technique-shows-promise-in-mice.html).
